(defn fold
  "Reduces a collection using a (potentially parallel) reduce-combine
  strategy. The collection is partitioned into groups of approximately
  n (default 512), each of which is reduced with reducef (with a seed
  value obtained by calling (combinef) with no arguments). The results
  of these reductions are then reduced with combinef (default
  reducef). combinef must be associative, and, when called with no
  arguments, (combinef) must produce its identity element. These
  operations may be performed in parallel, but the results will
  preserve order."
